              We may outsource the processing of your personal data to external
              parties including vendors, service providers, and other
              telecommunications operators who may process your personal data

              Privacy Policy. When we do so, we make sure they can only process
              your personal data strictly for the purpose stated in our contract
              with them. We also require them to protect your personal data with
              organizational, physical, and technical security measures
              consistent with our internal policies and ensure they return or
              dispose of your personal data upon the end of our engagement or as
              otherwise specified in our contract. With your consent, we will
              share your personal data with the Globe Group Portfolio Companies

              is our policy to never share your personal data with external
              parties unless we obtain your consent or are otherwise required or
              allowed by law to do so. To choose who you want us to share your
              personal data with to get access to new digital, financial, and
              medical services, you may update your consent preferences in the
              Privacy Dashboard of the New InBang App.
