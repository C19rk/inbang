          <h1>Website Terms & Conditions</h1>
          <p>
            Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using the
            Service. It is understood that upon submission of the registration
            form, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth
            below. If you do not wish to be bound by these terms and conditions,
            you may not access or use this Service. Globe Telecom may at any
            time modify this Agreement, and such modifications shall be
            effective immediately upon posting of the modified Agreement. You
            agree to review the Agreement periodically and your continued access
            or use of the Service shall be deemed your conclusive acceptance of
            the modified Agreement.
          </p>
          <h2>1. USE OF THE SERVICE</h2>
          <p>
            You understand that, except for information, products, or services
            clearly identified as being supplied by Globe Telecom, Globe Telecom
            does not in any way operate, control, or endorse any information,
            products, or services on the Internet. Except for Globe Telecom`s
            identified information, products, or services, all other
            information, products, and services offered through the Service or
            on the Internet generally are offered by third parties that are not
            affiliated with Globe Telecom. You understand that in case of
            conflict or inconsistencies between the online bill and the monthly
            bill received by you through mail or courier service, the latter
            shall prevail. If your online credit card payment has not been
            successfully executed, resulting to a dispute with your credit card
            company, you hereby authorize Globe Telecom to charge back to your
            account the unpaid bill. You understand that Globe Telecom cannot
            and does not guarantee or warrant that files available for
            downloading through the Service will be free of infection or
            viruses, worms, Trojan horses, or other code that manifest
            contaminating or destructive properties. You are responsible for
            implementing sufficient procedures and checkpoints to satisfy your
            particular requirements for accuracy of data input and output, and
            for maintaining a means external to the Service for the
            reconstruction of any lost data. You therefore assume total
            responsibility and risk for your use of the Service and the
            Internet. You understand that the Internet contains unedited
            materials, some of which are sexually explicit or may be offensive
            to you. You further understand that Globe Telecom has no control
            over and accepts no responsibility whatsoever for such materials.
            You may access such materials at your own risk. Globe Telecom does
            not make any express or implied warranties, representations, or
            endorsements whatsoever (including without limitation warranties of
            title or non-infringement, or the implied warranties of
            merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose) with regard to
            the Service, any merchandise, information, or service provided
            through the Service or on the Internet generally, and as such, Globe
            Telecom shall not be liable for any cost or damage arising either
            directly or indirectly from any such transaction. It is solely your
            responsibility to evaluate the accuracy, completeness, and
            usefulness of all opinions, advice, services, merchandise, and other
            information provided through the Service or on the Internet
            generally. Globe Telecom does not warrant that the Service will be
            uninterrupted or error-free or that defects in the Service will be
            corrected. The Service and any software made available on the
            Service are provided on an "as is, as available" basis.

            officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, suppliers, and
            any third party information providers to the Service from and
